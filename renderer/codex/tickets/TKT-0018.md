title: Clean up UrlGuardHooks export
---

## Context

Knip flagged `UrlGuardHooks` in `lib/security/urlGuard.ts` as an unused exported type. The goal is to confirm usage and remove the export if it is only consumed internally.

## Plan

- [x] Inspect `UrlGuardHooks` definition and identify all in-repo consumers.
- [x] Convert the type to a local-only definition when no external usage exists.
- [x] Document any knock-on cleanups or follow-up tickets if new scope appears.

## Acceptance

- [x] `UrlGuardHooks` is no longer exported while keeping existing internal hooks behaviour intact.
- [x] Follow-up items, if any, are logged or new tickets opened.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T09:20:06Z â€“ Investigated unused export and made the hooks type internal.
