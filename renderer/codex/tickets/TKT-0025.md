title: Remove unused WalletConnectionError export
---

## Context

> Knip flagged `components/auth/SeizeConnectContext.tsx` for exporting `WalletConnectionError` without any runtime consumers. We need to verify whether the symbol is dead code and remove it if so.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm `WalletConnectionError` has no production usages.
- [x] Remove the unused type or adjust visibility if it still has internal call sites.
- [x] Drop any tests that exercise only the deleted export.

## Acceptance

- [x] `WalletConnectionError` is removed or privatized depending on usage findings.
- [x] No remaining imports reference the deleted export.
- [ ] Knip no longer reports the export as unused.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T15:30:00Z – Began audit of `WalletConnectionError` export per Knip report.
- 2025-10-28T16:45:00Z – Confirmed export was unused externally, privatized class, and pruned tests relying on exported symbol.
