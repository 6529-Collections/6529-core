title: Add Discover link to app sidebar navigation
---

## Context

> The in-app sidebar navigation omits a link to the Discover experience, forcing users to rely on deep links or browser navigation. Restoring parity with the web sidebar should improve discoverability and align the app's UX. While iterating on these navigation fixes, we also spotted inconsistent search icons in the app waves and identity search inputs that should be updated to the shared Heroicons set.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the app sidebar component to confirm available navigation slots and icon usage.
- [x] Inject a Discover entry pointing to the existing Discover route with consistent styling and ordering.
- [ ] Validate navigation manually and adjust tests or stories if they cover sidebar entries.
- [ ] Update `WavesListSearch` and the identity search form to use the Heroicons search glyph.
- [ ] Ensure relevant tests reflect the updated icon rendering.

## Acceptance

- [ ] App sidebar includes a Discover item that routes to the Discover page.
- [ ] Sidebar highlight state updates correctly when visiting Discover.
- [ ] Waves list and identity search inputs render the Heroicons search icon consistently.
- [ ] `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, and targeted tests for the sidebar/search components pass locally.

## Log

- 2025-10-29T12:48:26Z – Tweaked `WaveItem` card aspect/gradient heights to reduce hero image height on small screens.
- 2025-10-29T12:50:55Z – Added a loading state and disabled interaction for the Waves “Show all” toggle to avoid jarring label flips.
- 2025-10-29T12:53:25Z – Brightened the “Show less” state and added directional icons so the toggle remains obvious after expansion.

- 2025-10-29T13:26:58Z – Switched the typing indicator background to a Tailwind gradient (bottom-up) for smoother blending.
