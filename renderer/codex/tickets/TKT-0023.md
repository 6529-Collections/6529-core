title: Remove unused HeaderMobileUtils utilities
---

## Context

Knip's unused files report surfaced `components/header/HeaderMobileUtils.tsx` as potentially dead code. The module only feeds its own test suite and is otherwise unreferenced across the app, so we need to retire it and clean up the redundant test.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm `HeaderMobileUtils` exports have no runtime usages.
- [x] Remove the stale utility module and its test coverage.
- [x] Update board metadata once cleanup is complete.

## Acceptance

- [x] `components/header/HeaderMobileUtils.tsx` no longer exists in the repository.
- [x] Associated tests referencing the removed module are deleted.
- [ ] Knip no longer reports the file as unused.
