title: Harden CustomTooltip positioning robustness
---

## Context

> Strengthen the reusable tooltip wrapper so hover cards render in the correct position on first reveal, even as content or viewport changes occur, while maintaining existing UX. Earlier investigation highlighted subtle layout drift when profile cards mounted.

## Plan

- [x] Audit current measurement flow, ref handling, and observer lifecycle for `CustomTooltip`.
- [x] Refactor positioning logic to use stable browser references, forward refs safely, and add responsive observers without altering behaviour.
- [ ] Capture validation notes, including automated checks and any required manual verification steps.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `CustomTooltip` maintains existing hover/focus behaviour on desktop and touch devices.
- [ ] Tests, lint, and type-check suites pass without new regressions.
- [ ] Manual smoke test confirms initial hover positioning anchors correctly.
