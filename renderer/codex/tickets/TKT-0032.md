title: Remove unused hasMetadataContent export
---

## Context

> Knip reports `hasMetadataContent` in `components/waves/CreateDropContent.tsx` as an unused export. We need to verify the signal and eliminate any dead code.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm whether `hasMetadataContent` is referenced anywhere in the project.
- [x] Remove the export or associated code if unused, keeping the component self-contained.
- [x] Update documentation and tests if removal affects them.

## Acceptance

- [x] `hasMetadataContent` is either proven necessary or removed without breaking the build.
- [x] Lint, tests, and type checks succeed after the change.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T16:51:08Z – Ticket created for export cleanup and initial investigation queued.
- 2025-10-28T16:55:57Z – Confirmed helper is only used internally, dropped the export, pruned the dedicated tests, and validated with test, lint, and type-check runs.
