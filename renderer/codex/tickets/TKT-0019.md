title: Make Wave card fully clickable
---

## Context

@waveitem reported that the Wave card currently exposes an eye icon button for navigation, but the expectation is that the entire card surface should link to the wave. This change keeps the UX consistent with the rest of the interface and removes redundant affordances.

## Plan

- [x] Review the current Wave card interactions and identify all navigation entry points.
- [x] Update the card to handle click and keyboard events across its surface without breaking nested controls.
- [x] Adjust and extend tests to cover the new interactions.

## Acceptance

- [x] Clicking any non-interactive area of a Wave card navigates to the wave detail view.
- [x] Existing interactive elements (like follow actions and contributor links) continue to work without unintended navigation.
- [x] Automated tests cover the navigation behavior.

## Log

- 2025-10-27T09:37:57Z – Captured request to remove the eye icon and make the card surface navigable.
- 2025-10-27T09:45:00Z – Wired full-card navigation, removed the legacy eye icon, and added interaction coverage.
- 2025-10-27T09:58:50Z – Polished card styling with hover/contrast refinements while keeping nested controls intact.
- 2025-10-27T10:14:47Z – Inlined Tailwind surface styling on the Wave card JSX, retained guarded navigation handlers, and added a space-key interaction test (`npm run test -- --runTestsByPath __tests__/components/waves/list/WaveItem.test.tsx`).
- 2025-10-27T10:32:05Z – Hardened Wave card links, tooltips, and images (prefetch opt-out, optional chaining, memoized gradients, lazy-loading avatars) per @waveitem’s follow-up; no new tests executed per guidance.
- 2025-10-27T10:34:45Z – Rolled back the new memoization helpers to keep the card implementation straightforward while retaining the other hardening tweaks; tests still not run.
- 2025-10-27T10:36:37Z – Adjusted the subscribers row to remain a flex container at large breakpoints so the icon/count stay vertically centered.
- 2025-10-27T10:37:17Z – Replaced inline SVGs with `@heroicons/react/24/outline` icons for chat and subscriber rows per styling request.
- 2025-10-27T10:39:25Z – Swapped the subscriber icon to `UsersIcon` to match the “two user” visual preference.
- 2025-10-27T10:40:37Z – Centered the author row by flex-aligning the container/link so avatar, handle, and level pill stay vertically aligned.
- 2025-10-27T10:41:59Z – Centered drop contributor avatars/count by aligning both rows with flex utilities.
- 2025-10-27T11:27:47Z – Increased Wave card and contributor avatar image scales to `AUTOx450` / `200x200` for sharper previews.
- 2025-10-27T11:33:06Z – Re-applied the higher-resolution Wave hero/author image scales after the Card layout tweaks.
- 2025-10-27T11:34:14Z – Tightened the hero overlay to a bottom-heavy gradient so the text block stays readable without dimming the whole image.
- 2025-10-27T11:43:58Z – Boosted wave hero, author, and contributor image requests to a new `250x250` scale for sharper rendering.
- 2025-10-27T11:46:17Z – Scoped the `250x250` scale to the wave hero only and restored author/contributor avatars to their lighter `AUTOx50` variant per request.
- 2025-10-27T11:47:13Z – Reverted the hero image to `AUTOx450`; CDN lacks a `250x250` variant so the asset vanished.
- 2025-10-27T12:09:23Z – Retried `250x250` for the hero (keeping avatars on `AUTOx50`) per latest request.
- 2025-10-27T12:12:45Z – Restored the hero image scale to `AUTOx450` to ensure the CDN-served asset renders reliably.
- 2025-10-27T14:06:24Z – Moved the Wave avatar/handle/level row below the hero image and above the meta bar to match the requested layout.
- 2025-10-28T18:25:00Z – Resolved nested anchor hydration errors by converting the card container to an accessible div-based link surrogate; lint/type-check succeeded, full test suite still blocked by pre-existing `UserAgentSanitizer` ReDoS timing failure.
