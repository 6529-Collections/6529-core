title: Remove unused getCollectionBaseBreadcrums export
---

## Context

Knip reports the `getCollectionBaseBreadcrums` export from `components/nextGen/nextgen_helpers.ts` as unused. We need to verify whether the helper is genuinely dead code and remove it if nothing depends on it.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm whether `getCollectionBaseBreadcrums` is referenced in application or test code.
- [x] Delete the helper (and related tests) if unreferenced, or de-export it if only used locally.
- [x] Run targeted checks as needed to ensure no regressions remain.

## Acceptance

- [x] No remaining references to `getCollectionBaseBreadcrums` exist outside the helper file.
- [ ] Helper is removed or scoped privately without breaking builds, linting, or types.
- [x] Ticket log captures verification steps run during cleanup.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T16:27:57Z – Ticket opened to validate and clean up unused helper export reported by Knip.
- 2025-10-28T16:28:32Z – Searched repository; helper is only referenced in tests, so plan is to remove helper and associated test coverage.
- 2025-10-28T16:32:33Z – Removed `getCollectionBaseBreadcrums` helper and deleted the now-redundant Jest tests.
- 2025-10-28T16:32:37Z – Ran `npm run test:cov:changed` (pass after extending timeout) and `npm run type-check`; `npm run lint` still fails due to pre-existing rule violations unrelated to this change.
