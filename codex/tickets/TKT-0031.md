title: Remove unused getPageMetadata helper
---

## Context

Knip's unused exports report highlights `components/providers/metadata.ts#getPageMetadata` as unused. The helper only feeds its local Jest suite, so we should retire it to reduce maintenance surface.

## Plan

- [x] Validate `getPageMetadata` has no runtime consumers.
- [x] Remove the helper and prune the tests that only exercised it.
- [x] Sync board metadata once cleanup is complete.

## Acceptance

- [x] `components/providers/metadata.ts` no longer exports `getPageMetadata`.
- [x] The companion Jest cases for `getPageMetadata` are deleted.
- [ ] Knip no longer reports the helper as unused.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T16:29:44Z – Confirmed helper lacked runtime usage and removed implementation plus dedicated tests.
- 2025-10-28T16:33:03Z – Added ticket row to `STATE.md` to reflect cleanup work.
