title: Remove unused HeaderUserProfile component
---

## Context

Knip flagged `components/header/user/HeaderUserProfile.tsx` as an unused file. We need to confirm the component has no live references and remove it (and related tests) if it is truly dead code.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm whether any production code imports or renders `HeaderUserProfile`.
- [x] Remove the component and associated tests if it is unused.

## Acceptance

- [x] `components/header/user/HeaderUserProfile.tsx` and any exclusive tests are removed.
- [x] No remaining references to the removed component exist in the codebase.

- 2025-10-28T14:52:22Z – Confirmed the component was unused and removed it along with the dedicated test.
