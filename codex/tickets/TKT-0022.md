title: Remove unused BrainLeftSidebarSearchWave dropdown
---

## Context

> Knip reported `components/brain/left-sidebar/search-wave/BrainLeftSidebarSearchWaveDropdown.tsx` as unused. We need to confirm whether the dropdown has any runtime references and remove it (and related tests) if it is dead code.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm the dropdown component has no runtime references in the app.
- [x] Delete the unused component and any tests or stories that only cover it.
- [x] Update exports or documentation that previously referenced the component.

## Acceptance

- [x] `components/brain/left-sidebar/search-wave/BrainLeftSidebarSearchWaveDropdown.tsx` and dependent tests are removed if unused.
- [x] No imports, exports, or barrel files reference the deleted module.
- [x] Knip no longer reports the dropdown component as unused.
