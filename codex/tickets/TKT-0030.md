title: Remove unused getNextMintNumber helper
---

## Context

> Knip flags the `getNextMintNumber` export in `components/meme-calendar/meme-calendar.helpers.tsx` as unused. We need to confirm the helper is dead code and delete it or adjust visibility accordingly.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm whether `getNextMintNumber` is referenced in the application or tests.
- [x] Remove the helper and related exports if unused, or adjust its scope if still needed.
- [x] Update the ticket with findings and verification steps.

## Acceptance

- [x] Helper is removed or scoped appropriately with no remaining unused export warnings from Knip for this symbol.
- [x] Unit tests, linting, and type checks continue to pass.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T16:40:31Z – Ticket opened to validate and remove the `getNextMintNumber` helper flagged by Knip as unused.
- 2025-10-28T16:45:37Z – Confirmed helper unused outside tests, deleted export, removed associated tests/docs, trimmed unused NextGen import to clear lint, and ran `npm run test:cov:changed`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run type-check` successfully.
