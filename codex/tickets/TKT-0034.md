title: Remove unused findLightDropBySerialNoWithPagination helper
---

## Context

Knip's unused exports report flags `contexts/wave/utils/wave-messages-utils.ts#findLightDropBySerialNoWithPagination`. We need to confirm whether the helper has any runtime consumers and remove the dead code if none exist.

## Plan

- [x] Validate `findLightDropBySerialNoWithPagination` has no runtime or test consumers.
- [x] Remove the helper or adjust its visibility based on actual usage.
- [x] Sync Codex state documentation after cleanup completes.

## Acceptance

- [x] `findLightDropBySerialNoWithPagination` is deleted or correctly scoped based on verified usage.
- [ ] Knip no longer reports the helper as an unused export.
- [x] Board metadata reflects the work status.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T17:03:12Z – Ticket opened to investigate the unused export flagged by Knip.
- 2025-10-28T17:08:30Z – Confirmed helper only had local usage, removed export, and refreshed tests to cover `fetchLightWaveMessages` behaviour.
- 2025-10-28T17:11:01Z – Ran `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run type-check` to verify the cleanup.
