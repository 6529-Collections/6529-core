title: Remove unused DropListItemContentPart export
---

## Context

> Knip's unused exports report flags the default export in `components/drops/view/item/content/DropListItemContentPart.tsx`. We need to verify whether this symbol is referenced anywhere and remove it if it is dead code.

## Plan

- [x] Inspect runtime usages of `DropListItemContentPart` to understand why Knip reports it.
- [x] Spike a static-import refactor to see if the dynamic require can be retired.
- [x] Capture guidance for future knip passes if the export must stay dynamic.

## Acceptance

- [x] Verified the export is exercised through runtime code paths.
- [x] Documented the remaining knip false positive for follow-up.
- [ ] All required project checks pass.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T18:00:00Z – Began audit of `DropListItemContentPart` default export per Knip cleanup request.
- 2025-10-28T19:30:00Z – Spiked a static import replacement; reverted after hitting test regressions caused by eager dynamic loader execution.
- 2025-10-28T20:00:00Z – Noted in ticket that the dynamic require is necessary to avoid early dynamic loader invocation; treating knip report as false positive for now.
